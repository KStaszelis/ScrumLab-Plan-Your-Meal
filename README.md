# ScrumLab React - Plan your meal App

This is a dynamic website powered by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that was designed to promote healthy eating lifestyle and emphasize the importance of meal planning. The website is a flagship of the author of the best-selling cookbook. I've used React-Router for navigation, React hooks for managing the state and I've styled this application with the use of SASS.

## Content

**The application consists of two sections:**
- **landing page** that encourages the use of the application
- **a browser application** that allows the following functions:
  - adding, modifying and deleting recipes,
  - displaying a list of recipes,
  - creating, viewing and modifying the weekly meal 
  
Each user will be able to manage the meal list also after closing the browser. Ultimately, the application will be posted on the website www.zaplanujjedzonko.pl.

## REST API

As part of the ScrumLab project, the basic structure of the `json-server` database was prepared. The file containing all the data is in the `database` folder under the name` db.json`.

We start the server with `npm run api` in a separate terminal tab. The server should be started on port `3000`: http: // localhost: 3000.
